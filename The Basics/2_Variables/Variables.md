# Variables

Variables are how programs temporarily store information, they work just like variables in math

In python variables are easier to declare than languages like java because you don't need to specify a type,
there are many types of variables by the notable few are String, int and boolean. Python takes some of the heavy lifting for us and assumes the type of variable, which can lead to some issues like trying to combine variables of different types

Go ahead and create a file called variables.py and type in the following

```
x = 10
y = 5
print(x+y)
```

run that with `python3 variables.py` and you should get an output of 15, this is because we stored 10 in the x variable and 5 in the y then printed the sum.
