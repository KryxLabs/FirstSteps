# Writing your first program

Writing your first program is one of the most important steps to becoming a good programmer

Go ahead and create a file called hello.py and in that file put the following lines

```
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello! "+name)
```
There are a few things going on here but lets look at the line

`name = input("What is your name? ")`

This takes user input from the terminal and assigns it to the variable name

`print("Hello! "+name)`

This prints "Hello!" then the value stored in the variable name to the terminal

You can run this program by typing in `python3 hello.py` in the terminal while in the directory with the program
